\subsection{Possible Solution}
\indent
Instead of backing up everything, what we need is:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Better ways to organize knowledge
 \item Reduce multiplicity
    \footnote{Check the section \ref{multiplicity}} 
    of knowledge. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Unified access interface}

What this idea proposes is, among other things, the centralized
access to knowledge, given that it is organized in a way that 
multiplicity is reduced and the problems caused by distributed
knowledge are minimized by merging the coverage of topics.
